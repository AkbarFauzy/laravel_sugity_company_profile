    'text' => 'Sugity, founded in 1995 as a collaborative venture between Superior Coach and Toyota Auto Body, embarked on a transformative journey that witnessed our commitment to innovation and precision. In 1996, Sugity inaugurated the production of Kijang SCM and Resin & Painting Parts, followed by the assembly of Dyna and Heavy Cabin in 1997. The year 2012 marked the commencement of NAV1 Assembly, complemented by on-site production at TMMIN Karawang Plant from 2011. Our dedication to advancement took a notable stride in 1997 with the establishment of Extrusion, a venture that evolved into an entity known today as TTEC (Toyota Auto Body - Tokai Extrusion) in 2005. The year 2000 witnessed the initiation of Plating production, subsequently evolving into an enterprise known as RPT (Resin Plating Technology) in 2013. Further enhancing our capabilities, we embraced in-house mold making in 2004, solidifying Sugity`s legacy in the automotive landscape.',
